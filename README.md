Overview
Gemmate helps you orchestrate teams of AI agents as a cohesive crew. You define roles, assign tasks, and set interaction rules. The platform coordinates agents to perform searches, view documents, extract insights, and produce outputs with voice or text. This is not a single AI agent. It is a framework to manage many specialized agents working together.

The design favors clarity and reliability. Each agent has a clearly defined capability, inputs, outputs, and a set of constraints. The orchestrator coordinates agent turns, tracks progress, and ensures accountability. The system is built with modern web technologies and a modular architecture to support future extensions and new agent types.

Core Concepts
- Agent: A specialized AI entity with a defined purpose. Examples include a search agent, a document analyzer, a summarizer, and a voice interface agent.
- Team: A group of agents working together to complete a set of tasks. A team can be static or dynamic, with agents joining or leaving as needed.
- Orchestrator: The brain of Gemmate. It assigns tasks, sequences steps, and coordinates inter-agent communication.
- Task: A unit of work that an agent performs. Tasks have inputs, expected outputs, deadlines, and success criteria.
- Workflow: A sequence of tasks that realizes a business or research objective. Workflows define how data moves between agents and how results are combined.
- Studio: The no-code or low-code UI for building teams, tasks, and workflows. Studio helps you visualize task graphs and tweak agent behavior without writing code.
- Studio Agent: A prebuilt or user-defined agent ready to be added to a team with minimal configuration.
- Data Plane: The persistence layer where tasks, conversations, and artifacts live. It supports query, export, and audit.
- Knowledge Surface: The set of sources the system can consult, including web results, uploaded documents, and internal databases.
- Voice Interface: A component that captures speech input, converts it to text, and reads responses aloud back to users.

Architecture and Design
Gemmate uses a modular, service-oriented approach. The orchestrator acts as the central conductor, while agents run in isolated components and communicate through a well-defined event bus. The Studio UI renders the task graphs and allows users to modify behavior without touching code. The data layer provides robust persistence, indexing, and search features so teams can reuse insights across sessions.

- Core services
  - Orchestrator service: Core logic for task assignment, sequencing, and coordination.
  - Agent services: Standalone runtimes capable of performing specific tasks.
  - Knowledge service: Stores and retrieves knowledge extracted by agents.
  - Voice service: Manages voice input and output for conversational tasks.
- Communication and data flow
  - Event bus: Publishes events such as task started, task completed, or error occurred.
  - API gateway: Exposes features to the front end and external clients.
  - Data layer: Persists entities and results with an emphasis on auditability.
- Deployment model
  - Local setups: Run components on a single machine for testing.
  - Cloud deployments: Run components as services behind load balancers.
  - Edge mode: Lightweight agents running near data sources to reduce latency.

Getting Started
This guide helps you set up Gemmate quickly. It covers prerequisites, installation, and the first workflow you can run.

Prerequisites
- Node.js 16.x or newer
- npm or pnpm
- A modern browser for Studio (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox)
- Optional: Docker if you want containerized runs

Install
- Visit the releases page to fetch the latest installer for your platform. From the Releases page, download the latest asset named gemmate-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz (as an example) and run the installer. This file is provided on the Releases page and is the simplest path to a working setup. See the link above for the assets. From the Releases page, download the latest asset and install.

- If you prefer a source-based setup, clone this repository and install dependencies:
  - Clear steps: clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, install dependencies, and start the development server.
  - Then run the development server to access Studio and the APIs.

Run locally
- Start the orchestrator and agents in development mode.
- Launch the Studio UI in your browser.
- Connect to your knowledge sources and start building a workflow.

Quick Start Guide
- Create a team with a search agent and a file analysis agent.
- Define a workflow to: fetch web results, pull documents, summarize, and deliver a final report.
- Add a voice interface to capture user requests and provide spoken summaries.
- Run the workflow and observe how data moves between agents.

Studio and No-Code UX
Studio is the visual authoring environment. It helps you assemble agents, connect data sources, and define task sequences. The UI displays the flow, shows data lineage, and highlights where each decision happens. Studio reduces the friction of building multi-agent systems.

- Create a new project: Give it a name and describe the objective.
- Add agents: Choose prebuilt agents or create custom ones.
- Define tasks: Each task has inputs, outputs, and success criteria.
- Connect tasks: Build a graph showing how data passes through the workflow.
- Run and observe: Start the workflow and watch the live console update.

Agent Templates and Profiles
Agents can be created from templates or custom definitions. Templates provide ready-made capabilities you can tailor to your needs. The profiles describe how an agent behaves, its data requirements, and its output structure. Use templates to speed up your setup and ensure consistency across teams.

- Everyday templates
  - Web search specialist
  - Document extractor
  - Summary generator
  - Voice interface
- Custom profiles
  - Define capabilities
  - Define inputs and outputs
  - Specify required data sources
  - Set safety and policy constraints

Web Search and Knowledge Integration
The web search agent retrieves information from the public web and trusted sources. The agent returns a concise set of results with source links and confidence scores. The knowledge surface stores the results to reuse in later steps.

- Source prioritization: Rank sources by relevance and recency.
- Result summarization: Provide short, actionable summaries.
- Source tracing: Keep references so you can audit conclusions.

File Analysis and Knowledge Workflows
The file analysis agent reads local and cloud files. It extracts data, detects key entities, and produces structured outputs. Workflows can use these outputs to build reports, answer questions, or feed into machine learning tasks.

- Supported formats: Text, PDFs, Word documents, spreadsheets.
- Data extraction: Table extraction, entity recognition, and keyword spotting.
- Security: Respect file permissions and avoid exposing sensitive data.

Voice Capabilities
Voice enables hands-free interaction. The speech-to-text and text-to-speech components work together to capture queries and deliver responses. You can enable voice prompts, confirmations, and spoken summaries at various points in a workflow.

- Speech input: Accept natural language requests.
- Spoken output: Deliver concise, natural-sounding answers.
- Voice customization: Choose voice style and speed.

Multi-Agent Orchestration and Task Flows
Gemmate coordinates a crew of agents to achieve complex goals. The orchestrator distributes tasks, handles inter-agent communication, and ensures timely completion. The multi-agent flow supports parallel processing, dependency chaining, and fallback strategies.

- Parallelization: Run independent tasks at the same time to save time.
- Dependency graphs: Ensure outputs feed into the next steps in the correct order.
- Conflict handling: Detect conflicting outputs and resolve them with rules.
- Rollback and retry: Re-run failed tasks with updated inputs.

API, CLI, and Extensibility
- API: A typed interface to interact with teams, agents, tasks, and workflows.
- CLI: Quick access to create, run, and monitor workflows from the command line.
- Extensibility: Add new agent types via plugins or adapters.
